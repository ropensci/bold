#' @section Marker:
#' Notes from BOLD on the \code{marker} param:
#' "All markers for a specimen matching the search string will be returned.
#' ie. A record with COI-5P and ITS will return sequence data for both
#' markers even if only COI-5P was specified."
#'
#' You will likely end up with data with markers that you did not request -
#' just be sure to filter those out as needed.

#' @note
#' If using the \code{taxon} parameter with another parameter, if the \code{taxon} isn't found in the public database, it will act as if no \code{taxon} was specified and try to return all the data for the other specified parameter. You can make sure that the \code{taxon} you're looking up has public records with \code{\link{bold_stats}}.
